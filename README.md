# What is AWS?

```
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud computing platform, offering 200+ 
universally featured resources, from infrastructure to machine learning. These 
combinable systems provide maximum usability and are designed expressly for the 
optimization of your application’s performance through content delivery features, 
data storage, and more.

With AWS, you pay only for the exact amount of assistance you require, resulting in 
lower capital commitment and enhanced time-to-value without compromising productivity.

After we highlight the top 25 AWS services, we’ve included a list of all AWS services. 
You can make use of the table of contents to navigate around.

storage services to various analytics and security applications.

# Why use AWS services?
``` 
Amazon, the preeminent cloud vendor, broke new ground by establishing the first cloud 
computing service, Amazon EC2, in 2008. AWS offers more solutions and features than any 
other provider and has free tiers with access to the AWS Console, where users can centrally 
control their ministrations.

Designed around ease-of-use for various skill sets, AWS is tailored for those unaccustomed to 
software development utilities. Web applications can be deployed in minutes with AWS facilities, 
without provisioning servers or writing additional code.

Amazon hosts global data centers with a vast network ensuring reduced latency worldwide. 
AWS’ replication capacity allows you to duplicate services regionally, helping you recover 
quickly and avoid costly downtime.

The number of AWS offerings is constantly growing, and as of September 2022, 
they include as many as 509 individual products and services.
